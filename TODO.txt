    [X] Honeycomb:
        1. Start by putting the character w/ the most interactions at the origin
        2. At each step, pick the character who has the most interactions summed
           across already-placed characters to pick next (break ties using
           total interactions, then neighbors, then ID).
        3. At each step, pick a spot for that character from among not-already-
           occupied vertices on a simplex grid that are adjacent to an occupied
           vertex.
        4. To choose a spot, evaluate the score of each vertex as a weighted
           sum of its distance from vertices occupied by already-placed nodes,
           according to the strength of connection with each of those nodes.
           The spot that has the minimum score is chosen, breaking ties towards
           the origin, and double-ties by which edge spot was added first.
[~] Fix into-the-sunset bug w/ unconnected nodes (attraction works at least)
[X] Loose layout should be looser: force # of ticks at moderate alpha & restart
[X] Affinity graphs
[X] don't show dlinks in affinity graphs (now shows labeled links)

[ ] More UI for inside vs. outside nodes?
[ ] add switch for building hive layout based on total interactions vs.
    interactions with placed nodes.
[ ] node radius slider positioning for narrow screens
[ ] toggle in listing to allow filtering by visible nodes
[ ] group assignment tool in visualizer!
[ ] Drag to select
[ ] Make labels continuous with data somehow?
[ ] More flexible neighbor limits in ego networks?
[ ] Mme de Cleves Ego network limit has both links bug!
[ ] Mme. Pontmercy in Miserables groups 8/5 affinity plot!
[ ] error message when we can't find the graph data
[ ] break hive layout ties AWAY from the origin?
[ ] hideable (and default-hidden) link labels for full network?
[ ] consistent treatment of initiated/received/total/neighbors for filtered
    graphs?
[ ] select groups from legend
[ ] scatter plots
[ ] DOT format
[ ] ego network outer edges
[ ] side-by-side
[ ] extra relationships
    [ ] history/timeline view
    [ ] visualize subjects - two copies of each node?
    [ ] locations? - bipartite?
