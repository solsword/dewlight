[X] Static layout algorithms:
    [X] Honeycomb:
        1. Start by putting the character w/ the most interactions at the origin
        2. At each step, pick the character who has the most interactions summed
           across already-placed characters to pick next.
        3. At each step, pick a spot for that character from among not-already-
           occupied vertices on a simplex grid that are adjacent to an occupied
           vertex.
        4. To choose a spot, evaluate the score of each vertex as a weighted
           sum of its distance from vertices occupied by already-placed nodes,
           according to the strength of connection with each of those nodes.
           The spot that has the minimum score is chosen, breaking ties towards
           the origin, and double-ties towards the bottom right.
[ ] Fix into-the-sunset bug w/ unconnected nodes
[ ] Loose layout should be looser: force # of ticks at moderate alpha & restart
