<h2 id="help:about">About</h2>
<p>Dewlight is a visualization tool for networks, specialized for medium-size networks with perhaps dozens of nodes, where edges are directional and weighted. It has multiple tools for visualizing connections between nodes and their relationships to each other. The visualization tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#help:relationships">Relationships</a>: This view shows the relationships between all nodes, with thicker lines connecting nodes that have stronger relationships. It treats relationships as reciprocal, and adds up the strength of connections in both directions between two nodes. Nodes are laid out on a grid so that nodes with stronger connections are closer to each other, and then a force simulation is used to relax their positions.</li>
<li><a href="#help:ego_network">Ego Network</a>: This view shows all of the connections from and to a single node. It displays directed edges separately, and arranges connected nodes in a circle around the central node.</li>
<li><a href="#help:affinity_plot">Affinity Plot</a>: This view shows the relative strength of connections to a group of reference nodes. The reference nodes are placed on the perimeter of a circle, and nodes of interest are placed inside, located based on their relative connection strength to each outer node. Like the relationships graph the affinity plot treats connections as reciprocal.</li>
<li><a href="#help:histograms">Histograms</a>: This view provides a more abstract view of the network, showing a histogram of one of several properties, like the number of initiated connections from each node, or the number of neighbors each node has. It can also display two histograms simultaneously to compare them.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the top left, the controls area shows <a href="#help:controls">global controls</a> and graph-specific controls (described in the help sections for each type of graph).</p>
<p>At the top right, there is a legend that shows the colors used for the current view. For most views, color is based on group, which is discussed in the <a href="#help:colors">colors</a> section.</p>
<p>On the bottom left, the current view is displayed. In all views, you can click on nodes (or bars in the <a href="#help:histograms">histograms</a> view) to select them. Selections filter which edges are visible, and also control how the <a href="#help:ego_network">ego network</a> and <a href="#help:affinity_plot">affinity plot</a> views behave.</p>
<p>On the bottom right, the <a href="#help:listing">listing</a> displays the ID of each node, along with its assigned symbol (if any), the number of neighbors it has, and the number of initiated, received, and total connections for that node.</p>
<h2 id="help:controls">Controls</h2>
<p>The global controls are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “show” drop-down menu controls which view is displayed.</li>
<li>The “filter nodes” check box controls whether all nodes are shown, or whether only important nodes are shown. It applies across all views, and also filters edges (only edges among included nodes are counted).</li>
<li>the “node radius” slider which controls how large each node is in the graph views.</li>
<li>The “clear selection” button allows you to deselect all currently selected nodes.</li>
<li>The “mark” menu controls which nodes are marked with a symbol in the current view and the <a href="#help:listing">listing</a>. The symbols can help you see which node is which without hovering over it, but can also be distracting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="help:relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>The relationships view displays the connections among all nodes in the graph, using an automatic layout that tries to put more-connected nodes close to each other, starting from the most-connected node. The positions in the graph can thus be interpreted (with caution) as implying relationships among nodes (use other views to confirm these).</p>
<p>You can drag around the nodes to adjust their position, but when you do that, the rest of the nodes will be allowed to move according to their constraints. By hovering over a node or selecting nodes (by clicking on them), you can limit which edges are shown, and hovering on a node or edge for a moment will display information about it.</p>
<p>The controls for this view are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “hide” check boxes for “marginal edges” and “passive edges.” These allow you to hide all edges that connect to marginal (or passive) nodes, to reduce clutter.</li>
<li>The “layout” selector, which allows you to switch between the “strict,” “loose,” and “relaxed” layouts (see below).</li>
<li>The “reset layout” button, which puts nodes back to their original positions for the selected layout.</li>
<li>The “relax further” button, which allows the nodes to settle more under the physical simulation rules (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>The position of the nodes is governed by two processes: the initial layout, and a physical simulation that includes several simulated forces.</p>
<h3 id="initial-layout">Initial Layout</h3>
<p>The initial layout results can be viewed without running the physical simulation at all by selecting the “strict” layout option. This layout places nodes on a triangular grid. To produce this layout, the following algorithm is used:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>At each step, select a single node to place on the graph:
<ul>
<li>For the first step, use the node that has the highest total combined interaction weight (weight of all outgoing + incomming links).</li>
<li>For subsequent steps, pick the node that has the most interaction weight with nodes that have already been placed. Ties are broken by total interaction weight across all nodes, then by number of neighbors, then by group (more-interacting groups first; see <a href="#help:colors">colors</a>), and finally by ascending alphabetical order of node IDs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next, place that node on the graph:
<ul>
<li>For the first step, place it at the origin (0, 0).</li>
<li>For subsequent nodes, examine all empty grid locations that are adjacent to an already-placed node: * At each location, compute the cost for that location as the weighted sum of the link lengths of each link from this node to a node that’s already been placed. This is just the length of each link (if the node were at this location) times its weight. * Pick the locaiton that has the lowest total cost, and put the node there. Ties are broken by choosing locations that are closer to the origin, and double-ties are broken by choosing the edge position that was added to the list of edge positions first.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Finally, repeat steps 1 and 2 until all nodes have been placed (including nodes not connected to the original node).</li>
</ol>
<p>This algorithm normally results in a roughly hexagonal group of nodes, even when connections aren’t thick, because it breaks ties towards the origin. The default listing sort order for this view shows the order in which nodes were added, which can help understand the layout, but in general, and especially for the first several characters placed, proximity in the layout indicates relative strength of connection (as things get crowded the grid constraints make this less strictly true).</p>
<p>Once the nodes are positioned in this grid, in the “loose” and “relaxed” layouts, relax those positions by simulating a few physical forces acting on the nodes in two dimensions.</p>
<h3 id="physical-simulation">Physical Simulation</h3>
<p>When the “relax” further button is clicked, when a node is dragged, or during layout construction for the “loose” and “relaxed” layouts, physical forces are simulated to position the nodes. The two main forces are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A repulsion force that pushes all nodes away from each other when they get too close. This prevents nodes from piling up and obscuring each other, but it also is the primary source of distortion that causes nodes <em>not</em> to be positioned as close to their neighbors as they would naturally be.</li>
<li>An attraction force along each link, that as long as the nodes aren’t overlapping, pulls them closer to each other, and gets stronger the farther the link is stretched. The strength of the attraction force is also proportional to the logarithm of the link value, so higher-weighted links pull a bit harder (but it’s not a huge difference).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these two main forces, there are several more forces to help arrange the nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A gathering force pulls all nodes towards the origin. This ensures that disconnected nodes to not drift away from the main part of the graph. This force is fairly weak, so it does not introduce very much distortion.</li>
<li><p>A “bubble” force that forces nodes in certain categories out of the center of the graph. Nodes with less than 10 total link weight (incoming + outgoing) are considered “marginal,” and they are all pushed outward from the center a set distance by a very strong force that’s stronger than most link forces. If they have several strong links to nodes in the central area, they can be pulled inwards a bit, but otherwise they will end up outside the bubble distance. Similarly, nodes that have zero outgoing links are considered “passive” and are pushed out to an even further distance. Again strong connections may pull them inward slightly (and observing those cases can be interesting) but otherwise they will form an outer ring in the graph once fully relaxed.</p>
<p>TODO: accuracy here</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The bubble force in particular shapes the arrangement of the graph after enough simulation of the physical forces has happened, which is why the “loose” and “relaxed” layouts apply different amounts of simulation to relax the graph. The “relax further” button can always be used to see the consequences of more simulation updates, and dragging nodes also activates the simulation system. The “loose” layout is an intermediate between the rigid grid of the “strict” layout and the more circular appearance of the “relaxed” layout (which is due to the bubble forces).</p>
<h2 id="help:ego_network">Ego Network</h2>
<p>This view shows detailed information about all of the connections at a single node. This focus node is in the center, and can be switched using a button in the control panel based on the most-recently-selected node. All nodes that are connected to the focus node are arrayed in a circle around the focus node, ordered by their strength of connection with the focus node starting from 0 degrees on the right and proceeding clockwise. Strength of connection also determines distance between the focus node and related nodes: the node that has the strongest relationship is placed at 1/2 the base radius, and nodes with weaker relationships are placed proportionally further out.</p>
<p>Unlike the other views, edges in this view are directional: each edge comes from its source node, and ends before reaching the destination node. In cases where an edge is not reciprocated, the edge ends 30% of the distance towards the target, in other cases, the gap between the edges is placed between 15% and 85% of the distance between the nodes, according to the ratio between incoming and outgoing weights. So a node that has a large weight on the edge from it to the focus node but only a small weight on the reverse edge will have the edges meet close to the focus node, and an node with opposite weights will have the edges meet far from the focus node. The weights of edges are also explicit in this view, instead of only being shown when an edge is hovered.</p>
<p>The controls for this view are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “viewing” area displays the ID of the focus node, and the nearby “switch to” button allows you to switch the focus node to be the most-recently-selected node. If the most-recently selected node is the focus node itself, or if there aren’t any selected nodes, the “switch to” button will be disabled.</li>
<li>The “limit neighbors” drop-down menu offers options for limiting how many neighbors are displayed, which can be useful when a node has too many neighbors to easily see them all. The options include limiting to a certain # of nodes (ranked by weight of edges from and to the focus node), limiting to a certain # of interactions (the sum of edge weights in either direction), limiting to a certain % of interactions (relative to the node with the most interactions with the focus node), or limiting based on the presence of incoming, outgoing, and/or both types of links.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this view, position around the circle, proximity to the central node, and edge thicknesses all help answer the same question: Which other nodes are most closely connected to the focus node? The lengths of paired directional edges to and from each other node also show the balance of weights from and to the central node. One-sided directional edges are also easy to spot, so you can identify which nodes have one-way connections with the focus node.</p>
<h2 id="help:affinity_plot">Affinity Plot</h2>
<p>The affinity plot shows the relative strength of relationship between one or more inner nodes and a set of at least two outer nodes. The outer nodes are arranged in a circle, and the inner nodes are placed within that circle according to the strength of connection they have with each outer node.</p>
<p>In fact, the position of each inner node is just a weighted average of the positions of the outer nodes, where the weights are the total weight of the edges in both directions between the inner node and each outer node.</p>
<p>In some cases this causes overlap issues, but the plots are most informative when you can see distinctions in how certain nodes are positioned within the plot. Decreasing the node radius using the “node radius” slider may help in cases where there is a lot of overlap.</p>
<p>The controls for this view are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “hide exterior links” and “hide interior links” check boxes allow you to hide certain links. “Exterior” links are links between two outside nodes, and “interior” links are links between two inside nodes. Since the focus of the affinity plot is the links between the interior and exterior nodes, hiding links within those groups often makes sense.</li>
<li>The “label edges” check box allows you to hide the numbers that show the strength of each edge (the placement of numbers also indicates which end of an edge had the higher initiated vs. received weight, although the exact breakdown is only shown in the <a href="#help:ego_network">ego network</a> or by hovering over an edge. This can be useful when things get cluttered.</li>
<li>The “update outside nodes” and “inside nodes” controls consist of four buttons that are normally disabled. When one or more nodes are selected, the first button in each group will be labeled with a ‘+’ followed by a number indicating how many nodes will be added to that group (outside or inside) when the button is clicked, and the second button will have a ‘-’, indicating how many nodes will be removed from the corresponding group. So for example, if you select a single node that’s at the edge of the graph (an outside node), the second “update outside nodes” button will display “-1”, and if you click it, that node will be removed from the outside nodes group. Because that node is already an outside node, the button to add outside notes will remain disabled, and the buttons for adding/removing inside nodes will also be unavailable (to make an outside node into an inside node, you must first remove it from the outside group and then add it to the inside group). To add nodes that aren’t already part of the plot, select them using the <a href="#help:listing">listing</a>. The “clear selection” button may be useful in this view, because even after removing nodes from the plot, they remain selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this view, the position of the outside node is fixed (they are sorted around the circle by total edge weight, with ties broken by initiated edge weight and then alphabetically by ID). The position of the inside nodes is determined by which outside nodes they are most strongly connected to, however, and the purpose of the affinity plot is to be able to compare these connection strengths. If there are more than three outside nodes, position on the interior is ambiguous: exactly which characters on one edge of the circle pulled the node to that side should be inspected by looking at specific edges. So if two inside nodes are close to each other, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they have exactly the same pattern of relationships with the exterior nodes. However, if two nodes are placed differently, it <em>does</em> mean that they have different relationship patterns, and if there are only two or three outside nodes, then similar interior placement does imply similar relationships patterns.</p>
<h2 id="help:histograms">Histograms</h2>
<p>This view helps provide context for the edge weights used in the other views. By displaying a histogram of values (such as interactions, which is total initiated + received weight) this view gives a sense of how large or small a particular value is relative to all of the nodes in the graph. Each histogram displays a list of numbers along the x-axis, which are the distinct values present among all nodes, and for each value, there’s a bar indicating how many nodes had that much total edge weight, with a number on top indicating the precise count. So the x-axis is the combined edge weight (or # of neighbors) depending on which graph is selected, and the y-axis is the total number of nodes that have that combined edge weight (or # of neighbors).</p>
<p>This view can plot a histogram of the initiated weight, the received weight or the initiated + received weight (interactions). It can also plot a histogram of the number of neighbors each node has. In addition, you can select two histograms at once and it will plot one above the x-axis and one below so you can compare them visually (this really only makes sense for comparing among initiated, received and initiated + received graphs).</p>
<p>The width of each bar is determined by how many bars can fit in the graph area, but there is a minimum, and so if there are too many distinct values to display, you will have to scroll the graph horizontally to see them all. The height of the bars is determined such that the largest bar fills up the available vertical space, so only relative heights are relevant. When two graphs are shown, they are <em>not</em> scaled independently, so that the relative height of bars above and below the x-axis can be compared directly.</p>
<p>The controls for this view are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “graph” and “compare” selectors, along with a check box for “compare.” The check box can be used to disable or enable comparison, and the selectors let you decide which values to plot.</li>
<li>The “collapse values” check box controls how the x-axis is laid out. If checked (the default) then the x-axis will be compressed and numbers for which there is no node that has that much total weight (or that many neighbors) are not shown. This view makes it easier to see all of the bars at once, but means that distance along the x-axis is an unreliable indicator of relative total weight. If this box is unchecked, every integer will be shown on the x-axis up to the number for the node with the largest total weight (or largest neighborhood), which will usually force the graph to be scrolled to view all bars. Numbers where there are no corresponding nodes will have no bar above them. In this view, scrolling is usually necessary, but horizontal comparisons of position are valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the histogram view, selection works a bit differently than in other views. You can still use the <a href="#help:listing">listing</a> to select individual nodes, and this will highlight the bar(s) that they belong to (hovering on a bar will also display the ID of all nodes associated with it, although in some cases the list may be too long to fit on the screen). However, clicking on a bar will select <em>all</em> nodes that belong to that bar, and any other bar(s) they belong to (in the comparison view). Whether all or only some nodes at a bar are selected (e.g., because they were selected using the listing), clicking on that bar deselects all of them. So if you want to know which nodes have a total outgoing weight of exactly 5, you can select the “initiated” histogram, and click on the bar above the number 5 on the x-axis.</p>
<h2 id="help:colors">Colors</h2>
<p>In the top-right of the window, there is a “Colors” panel which displays a legend for the current graph. In the <a href="#help:relationships">relationships</a>, <a href="#help:ego_network">ego network</a>, and <a href="#help:affinity_plot">affinity plot</a> views, this displays one color for each node group, along with the name of that group. In the <a href="#help:histogram">histogram</a> view, it displays the different colors used for each different value that can be used to plot a histogram, which is useful when comparing histograms to distinguish which is which.</p>
<p>TODO: group assignment tool in visualizer! The groups and their names are defined as part of the dataset. If the dataset was constructed using the included <code>build_graph.py</code> script, the groups will be defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Main” nodes have more than 1/2 as much total outgoing (initiated) weight as the single node with the largest outgoing weight.</li>
<li>“Major” nodes have more than 1/3 as much total outgoing weight as the node with the largest outgoing weight.</li>
<li>“Minor” nodes have more than 1/6 as much total outgoing weight as the node with the highest weight, <em>or</em> have more than the average (mean) outgoing weight.</li>
<li>“Marginal” nodes do not qualify as “Minor” but have more than zero outgoing weight.</li>
<li>“Passive” nodes have zero outgoing weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="help:listing">Listing</h2>
<p>The listing area is on the right of the screen, and contains a list of all nodes in the graph. It has controls for sorting or filtering nodes, and also displays statistics for each node.</p>
<p>In every view except the ego network view, the stats displayed are total values according to the whole graph: outgoing weight (labeled ‘🗣’), incoming weight (labeled ‘👂’), combined weight (labeled ‘=’), and number of distinct neighbors (labeled ‘⇔’). The ego view displays the same stats, but except for the number of neighbors, they are filtered to include only edges present in the currently displayed ego network (in other words, only the weights on the edges to/from the current focus node).</p>
<p>The controls for the listing area are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “sort by” drop-down menu allows you to pick a property to sort by. Each property includes various fall-backs for breaking ties, usually in terms of whatever edge weights haven’t been considered in the initial sort. The “default” sort order depends on the current view:
<ul>
<li>For the <a href="#help:relationships">relationships</a> view, it sorts according to the order nodes were added to the layout (see details in that entry).</li>
<li>For the <a href="#help:ego_network">ego network</a> view, it sorts according to the combined incoming and outgoing edge weight between each node and the current focus node, putting the focus node first. Nodes that don’t appear in the current ego network are sorted to the bottom according to their group and then alphabetically by ID.</li>
<li>For the <a href="#help:affinity_plot">affinity plot</a> view, it puts the outside characters first, then the inside characters, and then the rest of the characters, and in each group, it sorts by total weight of edges that connect just to the outside nodes (so for outside nodes, it sorts on connections among them, and for inside and other nodes, it sorts on their connection to the current outside node set). Ties on connections to the outside nodes are broken by total interactions, group, and then ID.</li>
<li>For the <a href="#help:histograms">histograms</a> view the graph is sorted by the property used in the currently selected primary histogram (so outgoing weight, incoming weight, combined weight, or number of neighbors). These orderings, along with sorting by name and sorting by group and then game, are also available directly from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The “find” text field allows you to type part of a node ID and the listing will be filtered as you type to show only nodes that contain the fragment you’ve typed as part of their ID (ignoring case). The clear button directly after the filter input just clears what you’ve typed and resets the filter; deleting everything in the text box also effectively resets the filter.</li>
</ul>
